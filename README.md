# Lumiswap

This is an alternative interface to Uniswap V2 contracts deployed on an EVM blockchain modified to be used on Mantle Network. We used ReactJS for the project, with the EthersJS and Web3-React modules to connect to the blockchain via metamask in the browser, and TailwindCSS and HeadlessUI for the frontend. Hosted through Vercel.
